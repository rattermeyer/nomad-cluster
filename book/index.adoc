== About

The Open Delivery Platform project provides a fully working Continuous Delivery environment based on
Nomad, Docker and Gitlab.
The project was started to experiment with diffferent options and to have a playground.
The idea is, that no project and team is the same. It does not make sense to provide a completely
opinionated platform.
Basically it should be possible to exchange any of the components used in this projects with other components, so you
can customize the platform according to your needs.
I will show you some ways how to come to valid architectural decisions.

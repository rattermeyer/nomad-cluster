== Platform Description

This chapter explains how to setup a release version of the platform and
what components you find, what they are used for and how to find your
way around.

=== Environment Preparation
==== Vagrant

You will need a working https://vagrantup.com[Vagrant] / https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] combination.
Currently I am using vagrant 2.0.1 / VirtualBox 5.1.30 under Ubuntu 16.04.

The root directory contains a `Vagrantfile` that specifies a https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/multi-machine/[multi machine] setup.
This setup will create one ansible controller and the actual platform nodes.
The further setup is run from the ansible controller.
